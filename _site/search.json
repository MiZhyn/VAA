    "text": "4. Using tidygraph to create network objects\ntidygraph package provides a tidy API for graph/network manipulation. While network data itself is not tidy, it can be envisioned as two tidy tables, one for node data and one for edge data. tidygraph provides a way to switch between the two tables and provides dplyr verbs for manipulating them.\nTwo functions of tidygraph package can be used to create network objects, they are:\n\ntbl_graph() creates a tbl_graph network object from nodes and edges data.\nas_tbl_graph() converts network data and objects to a tbl_graph network\n\n\n4.1 Using tbl_graph() to build tidygraph’s graph object\n\nGAStech_graph &lt;- tbl_graph(nodes = GAStech_nodes,\n                           edges = GAStech_edges_aggregated, \n                           directed = TRUE)\n\nGAStech_graph\n\n# A tbl_graph: 54 nodes and 1372 edges\n#\n# A directed multigraph with 1 component\n#\n# Node Data: 54 × 4 (active)\n      id label               Department     Title                               \n   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;               &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;chr&gt;                               \n 1     1 Mat.Bramar          Administration Assistant to CEO                    \n 2     2 Anda.Ribera         Administration Assistant to CFO                    \n 3     3 Rachel.Pantanal     Administration Assistant to CIO                    \n 4     4 Linda.Lagos         Administration Assistant to COO                    \n 5     5 Ruscella.Mies.Haber Administration Assistant to Engineering Group Mana…\n 6     6 Carla.Forluniau     Administration Assistant to IT Group Manager       \n 7     7 Cornelia.Lais       Administration Assistant to Security Group Manager \n 8    44 Kanon.Herrero       Security       Badging Office                      \n 9    45 Varja.Lagos         Security       Badging Office                      \n10    46 Stenig.Fusil        Security       Building Control                    \n# ℹ 44 more rows\n#\n# Edge Data: 1,372 × 4\n   from    to Weekday Weight\n  &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;ord&gt;    &lt;int&gt;\n1     1     2 Sunday       5\n2     1     2 Monday       2\n3     1     2 Tuesday      3\n# ℹ 1,369 more rows\n\n\n\nThe output above reveals that GAStech_graph is a tbl_graph object with 54 nodes and 1372 edges.\nThe command also prints the first six rows of “Node Data” and the first three of “Edge Data”.\nIt states that the Node Data is active. The notion of an active tibble within a tbl_graph object makes it possible to manipulate the data in one tibble at a time.\n\nThe nodes tibble data frame is activated by default, but you can change which tibble data frame is active with the activate() function. Thus, if we wanted to rearrange the rows in the edges tibble to list those with the highest “weight” first, we could use activate() and then arrange().\n\nGAStech_graph %&gt;%\n  activate(edges) %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(Weight))\n\n# A tbl_graph: 54 nodes and 1372 edges\n#\n# A directed multigraph with 1 component\n#\n# Edge Data: 1,372 × 4 (active)\n    from    to Weekday   Weight\n   &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;ord&gt;      &lt;int&gt;\n 1    40    41 Saturday      13\n 2    41    43 Monday        11\n 3    35    31 Tuesday       10\n 4    40    41 Monday        10\n 5    40    43 Monday        10\n 6    36    32 Sunday         9\n 7    40    43 Saturday       9\n 8    41    40 Monday         9\n 9    19    15 Wednesday      8\n10    35    38 Tuesday        8\n# ℹ 1,362 more rows\n#\n# Node Data: 54 × 4\n     id label           Department     Title           \n  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;           &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;chr&gt;           \n1     1 Mat.Bramar      Administration Assistant to CEO\n2     2 Anda.Ribera     Administration Assistant to CFO\n3     3 Rachel.Pantanal Administration Assistant to CIO\n# ℹ 51 more rows\n\n\n\n\n4.2 Plotting Network Data with ggraph package\nggraph builds upon three core concepts that are quite easy to understand:\n\nThe Layout defines how nodes are placed on the plot, that is, it is a conversion of the relational structure into an x and y value for each node in the graph. ggraph has access to all layout functions available in igraph and furthermore provides a large selection of its own, such as hive plots, treemaps, and circle packing.\nThe Nodes are the connected entities in the relational structure. These can be plotted using the geom_node_*() family of geoms. Some node geoms make more sense for certain layouts, e.g. geom_node_tile() for treemaps and icicle plots, while others are more general purpose, e.g. geom_node_point().\nThe Edges are the connections between the entities in the relational structure. These can be visualized using the geom_edge_*() family of geoms that contain a lot of different edge types for different scenarios. Sometimes the edges are implied by the layout (e.g. with treemaps) and need not be plotted, but often some sort of line is warranted.\n\nPlotting the basic network graph with ggraph(), geom_edge_link() and geom_node_point()\nThe basic plotting function is ggraph(), which takes the data to be used for the graph and the type of layout desired. Both of the arguments for ggraph() are built around igraph. Therefore, ggraph() can use either an igraph object or a tbl_graph object.\ntheme_graph() removes redundant elements in order to focus on the network data\n\nggraph(GAStech_graph) +\n  geom_edge_link(aes(color = 'grey50')) +\n  geom_node_point(aes(color = 'grey40')) + \n  theme_graph(background = \"black\",\n              text_colour = \"white\")\n\n\n\n\nChanging the layout\n\nggraph(GAStech_graph, \n            #\"fr\" stands for Fruchterman and Reingold layout\n            layout = \"fr\") +\n  geom_edge_link(aes()) +\n  geom_node_point(aes()) + \n  theme_graph()\n\n\n\n\nModifying the nodes to the respective departments\n\nggraph(GAStech_graph, \n            layout = \"nicely\") + \n  geom_edge_link(aes()) +\n  #geom_node_point is equivalent to geom_point in ggplot2\n  geom_node_point(aes(colour = Department, \n                      size = 3)) + \n  theme_graph()\n\n\n\n\nModifying the edges (line thickness) to the weight variable\n\nggraph(GAStech_graph, \n            layout = \"nicely\") +\n  \n  #geom_edge_link draws edges in the simplest way - as straight lines between the start and end nodes. But, it can do more that that. In the example above, argument width is used to map the width of the line in proportional to the Weight attribute and argument alpha is used to introduce opacity on the line.\n  geom_edge_link(aes(width=Weight), \n                 alpha=0.2) +\n  scale_edge_width(range = c(0.1, 5)) +\n  geom_node_point(aes(colour = Department), \n                  size = 3) + \n  theme_graph()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.3 Creating facet graphs\nIn visualising network data, faceting can be used to reduce edge over-plotting in a very meaning way by spreading nodes and edges out based on their attributes. In this section, faceting techniques are used to visualise network data.\nThere are three functions in ggraph to implement faceting, they are:\n\nfacet_nodes() whereby edges are only drawn in a panel if both terminal nodes are present here,\nfacet_edges() whereby nodes are always drawn in al panels even if the node data contains an attribute named the same as the one used for the edge facetting, and\nfacet_graph() faceting on two variables simultaneously.\n\nExample with facet_nodes()\n\nset_graph_style()\n\ng &lt;- ggraph(GAStech_graph, \n            layout = \"nicely\") + \n  geom_edge_link(aes(width=Weight), \n                 alpha=0.2) +\n  scale_edge_width(range = c(0.1, 5)) +\n  geom_node_point(aes(colour = Department), \n                  size = 2)\n  \ng + facet_nodes(~Department)+\n  th_foreground(foreground = \"grey80\",  \n                border = TRUE) +\n  theme(legend.position = 'bottom')\n\n\n\n\nExample with facet_edges()\n\nset_graph_style()\n\ng &lt;- ggraph(GAStech_graph, \n            layout = \"nicely\") + \n  geom_edge_link(aes(width=Weight), \n                 alpha=0.2) +\n  scale_edge_width(range = c(0.1, 5)) +\n  geom_node_point(aes(colour = Department), \n                  size = 2) \n\ng + facet_edges(~Weekday) +\n  \n  #add frame to the facets\n  th_foreground(foreground = \"grey80\",  \n                border = TRUE) +\n  theme(legend.position = 'bottom')"

    "text": "In this hands-on exercise, I will show how to create animated data visualisation by using gganimate and plotly r packages. At the same time, I will also show how to (i) reshape data by using tidyr package, and (ii) process, wrangle and transform data by using dplyr package.\n\n\n\n\nFirst, write a code chunk to check, install and load the following R packages:\n\nplotly, R library for plotting interactive statistical graphs.\ngganimate, an ggplot extension for creating animated statistical graphs.\ngifski converts video frames to GIF animations using pngquant’s fancy features for efficient cross-frame palettes and temporal dithering. It produces animated GIFs that use thousands of colors per frame.\ngapminder: An excerpt of the data available at Gapminder.org. We just want to use its country_colors scheme.\ntidyverse, a family of modern R packages specially designed to support data science, analysis and communication task including creating static statistical graphs.\n\n\npacman::p_load(readxl, gifski, gapminder,\n               plotly, gganimate, tidyverse)\n\n\n\n\n\ncol &lt;- c(\"Country\", \"Continent\")\nglobalPop &lt;- read_xls(\"Data/GlobalPopulation.xls\",\n                      sheet=\"Data\") %&gt;%\n  mutate_at(col, as.factor) %&gt;%\n  mutate(Year = as.integer(Year))\n\nhe purpose of mutate_at is: to apply the as.factor transformation to the columns named “Country” and “Continent” in the data frame, i.e., to convert them from character strings to factor type.\nInstead of using mutate_at(), across() can be used to derive the same outputs.\n\n\n\n\ngganimate extends the grammar of graphics as implemented by ggplot2 to include the description of animation. It does this by providing a range of new grammar classes that can be added to the plot object in order to customise how it should change with time.\n\ntransition_*() defines how the data should be spread out and how it relates to itself across time.\nview_*() defines how the positional scales should change along the animation.\nshadow_*() defines how data from other points in time should be presented in the given point in time.\nenter_*()/exit_*() defines how new data should appear and how old data should disappear during the course of the animation.\nease_aes() defines how different aesthetics should be eased during transitions.\n\n\nggplot(globalPop, aes(x = Old, y = Young, \n                      size = Population, \n                      colour = Country)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.7, \n             show.legend = FALSE) +\n  scale_colour_manual(values = country_colors) +\n  scale_size(range = c(2, 12)) +\n  labs(title = 'Year: {frame_time}', \n       x = '% Aged', \n       y = '% Young') \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntransition_time() of gganimate is used to create transition through distinct states in time (i.e. Year).\nease_aes() is used to control easing of aesthetics. The default is linear. Other methods are: quadratic, cubic, quartic, quintic, sine, circular, exponential, elastic, back, and bounce.\n\n\nggplot(globalPop, aes(x = Old, y = Young, \n                      size = Population, \n                      colour = Country)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.7, \n             show.legend = FALSE) +\n  scale_colour_manual(values = country_colors) +\n  scale_size(range = c(2, 12)) +\n  labs(title = 'Year: {frame_time}', \n       x = '% Aged', \n       y = '% Young') +\n  transition_time(Year) +       \n  ease_aes('linear')          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this sub-section, you will learn how to create an animated bubble plot by using ggplotly() method.\nIn Plotly R package, both ggplotly() and plot_ly() support key frame animations through the frame argument/aesthetic. They also support an ids argument/aesthetic to ensure smooth transitions between objects with the same id (which helps facilitate object constancy).\n\ngg &lt;- ggplot(globalPop, \n       aes(x = Old, \n           y = Young, \n           size = Population, \n           colour = Country)) +\n  geom_point(aes(size = Population,\n                 frame = Year),\n             alpha = 0.7, \n             show.legend = FALSE) +\n  scale_colour_manual(values = country_colors) +\n  scale_size(range = c(2, 12)) +\n  labs(x = '% Aged', \n       y = '% Young')\n\nWarning in geom_point(aes(size = Population, frame = Year), alpha = 0.7, :\nIgnoring unknown aesthetics: frame\n\nggplotly(gg)\n\nWarning in p$x$data[firstFrame] &lt;- p$x$frames[[1]]$data: number of items to\nreplace is not a multiple of replacement length\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that although show.legend = FALSE argument was used, the legend still appears on the plot.

    "text": "3.4 Interactive Data Visualisation - ggiraph methods\nInteractive is made with ggplot geometries that can understand three arguments:\n\nTooltip: a column of data-sets that contain tooltips to be displayed when the mouse is over elements.\nOnclick: a column of data-sets that contain a JavaScript function to be executed when elements are clicked.\nData_id: a column of data-sets that contain an id to be associated with elements.\n\n\n3.4.1 Tooltip effect with tooltip aesthetic\nBelow shows a typical code chunk to plot an interactive statistical graph by using ggiraph package. Notice that the code chunk consists of two parts. First, an ggplot object will be created. Next, girafe() of ggiraph will be used to create an interactive svg object.\n\np &lt;- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(\n    aes(tooltip = ID),\n    stackgroups = TRUE, \n    binwidth = 1, \n    method = \"histodot\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(NULL, \n                     breaks = NULL)\ngirafe(\n  ggobj = p,\n  width_svg = 6,\n  height_svg = 6*0.618\n)\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that two steps are involved. First, an interactive version of ggplot2 geom (i.e. geom_dotplot_interactive()) will be used to create the basic graph. Then, girafe() will be used to generate an svg object to be displayed on an html page.\n\n\n3.5.1 Displaying multiple information on tooltip\nThe content of the tooltip can be customised by including a list object as shown in the code chunk below.\n\nexam_data$tooltip &lt;- c(paste0(     \n  \"Name = \", exam_data$ID,         \n  \"\\n Class = \", exam_data$CLASS)) \n\np &lt;- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(\n    aes(tooltip = exam_data$tooltip), \n    stackgroups = TRUE,\n    binwidth = 1,\n    method = \"histodot\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(NULL,               \n                     breaks = NULL)\ngirafe(\n  ggobj = p,\n  width_svg = 8,\n  height_svg = 8*0.618\n)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first three lines of codes in the code chunk create a new field called tooltip. At the same time, it populates text in ID and CLASS fields into the newly created field. Next, this newly created field is used as tooltip field as shown in the code of line 7.\n\n\n3.6.1 Customising Tooltip style\nCode chunk below uses opts_tooltip() of ggiraph to customize tooltip rendering by add css declarations.\n\ntooltip_css &lt;- \"background-color:pink; #&lt;&lt;\nfont-style:bold; color:black;\" #&lt;&lt;\n\np &lt;- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(              \n    aes(tooltip = ID),                   \n    stackgroups = TRUE,                  \n    binwidth = 1,                        \n    method = \"histodot\") +               \n  scale_y_continuous(NULL,               \n                     breaks = NULL)\ngirafe(                                  \n  ggobj = p,                             \n  width_svg = 6,                         \n  height_svg = 6*0.618,\n  options = list(    #&lt;&lt;\n    opts_tooltip(    #&lt;&lt;\n      css = tooltip_css)) #&lt;&lt;\n)                                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.6.2 Displaying statistics on tooltip\nCode chunk below shows an advanced way to customise tooltip. In this example, a function is used to compute 90% confident interval of the mean. The derived statistics are then displayed in the tooltip.\n\ntooltip &lt;- function(y, ymax, accuracy = .01) {\n  mean &lt;- scales::number(y, accuracy = accuracy)\n  sem &lt;- scales::number(ymax - y, accuracy = accuracy)\n  paste(\"Mean maths scores:\", mean, \"+/-\", sem)\n}\n\ngg_point &lt;- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n                   aes(x = RACE)) +\n  stat_summary(aes(y = MATHS, \n                   tooltip = after_stat(  \n                     tooltip(y, ymax))),  \n    fun.data = \"mean_se\", \n    geom = GeomInteractiveCol,  \n    fill = \"light blue\"\n  ) +\n  stat_summary(aes(y = MATHS),\n    fun.data = mean_se,\n    geom = \"errorbar\", width = 0.2, linewidth = 0.2\n  )\n\ngirafe(ggobj = gg_point,\n       width_svg = 8,\n       height_svg = 8*0.618)\n\n\n\n\n\nIt creates a function called tooltip that takes three arguments:\n\ny: a numeric value representing the mean.\nymax: a numeric value representing the mean plus the standard error.\naccuracy: a parameter controlling the numeric precision, defaulting to 0.01.\n\nNext, the code creates a ggplot object called gg_point. It uses the exam_data dataset and sets the RACE column as the x-axis. It then adds two layers:\n\nA stat_summary() layer using the GeomInteractiveCol geom to display the means, and using the tooltip function to generate a tooltip for each bar showing the mean maths score and its standard error.\nA stat_summary() layer using error bars to display the standard errors of the means.\n\nSpecifically, the workflow of stat_summary() is as follows:\n\nBased on the statistical function specified by the fun.data parameter (here, it’s mean_se, which calculates the mean and standard error), the data is grouped, and the statistics are calculated.\nThe statistical results for each group are calculated, with the mean stored in y and the mean plus the standard error stored in ymax.(ggplot2 is performing them behind the scenes based on the mean_se specification, and storing the mean in y and mean+SE in ymax, following its built-in rules.)\nAt this point, after_stat() can access the calculated results y and ymax.\nThe function within after_stat() (here, it’s tooltip(y, ymax)) takes the calculated results y and ymax as inputs and generates a new derived value (in this case, a formatted string based on the mean and standard error).\nThis derived value is mapped to a particular attribute of the geometric object; in this example, it’s the tooltip attribute of GeomInteractiveCol.\n\n\n\n3.6.3 Hover effect with data_id aesthetic\nCode chunk below shows the second interactive feature of ggiraph, namely data_id.\n\np &lt;- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(           \n    aes(data_id = CLASS),             \n    stackgroups = TRUE,               \n    binwidth = 1,                        \n    method = \"histodot\") +               \n  scale_y_continuous(NULL,               \n                     breaks = NULL)\ngirafe(                                  \n  ggobj = p,                             \n  width_svg = 6,                         \n  height_svg = 6*0.618                      \n)                                        \n\n\n\n\n\nWhen stackgroups = TRUE, it means that the dots will be stacked or grouped vertically based on their values on the x-axis (which in this case is the “MATHS” variable). Dots with the same x-value will be stacked on top of each other, rather than being spread out horizontally.\nIf stackgroups = FALSE (the default value), the dots would be spread out horizontally, even if they have the same x-value. This can lead to overlapping dots and make it difficult to discern the distribution of data points.\n\n\n3.6.4 Styling hover effect\nIn the code chunk below, css codes are used to change the highlighting effect.\n\np &lt;- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(              \n    aes(data_id = CLASS),              \n    stackgroups = TRUE,                  \n    binwidth = 1,                        \n    method = \"histodot\") +               \n  scale_y_continuous(NULL,               \n                     breaks = NULL)\ngirafe(                                  \n  ggobj = p,                             \n  width_svg = 6,                         \n  height_svg = 6*0.618,\n  options = list(                        \n    opts_hover(css = \"fill: #202020;\"),  \n    opts_hover_inv(css = \"opacity:0.2;\") \n  )                                        \n)                                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.6.5 Combining tooltip and hover effect\n\np &lt;- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(              \n    aes(tooltip = CLASS, \n        data_id = CLASS),              \n    stackgroups = TRUE,                  \n    binwidth = 1,                        \n    method = \"histodot\") +               \n  scale_y_continuous(NULL,               \n                     breaks = NULL)\ngirafe(                                  \n  ggobj = p,                             \n  width_svg = 6,                         \n  height_svg = 6*0.618,\n  options = list(                        \n    opts_hover(css = \"fill: #202020;\"),  \n    opts_hover_inv(css = \"opacity:0.2;\") \n  )                                        \n)                                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.6.6 Click effect with onclick\nonclick argument of ggiraph provides hotlink interactivity on the web.\nThe code chunk below shown an example of onclick.\n\nexam_data$onclick &lt;- sprintf(\"window.open(\\\"%s%s\\\")\",\n\"https://www.moe.gov.sg/schoolfinder?journey=Primary%20school\",\nas.character(exam_data$ID))\n\np &lt;- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(              \n    aes(onclick = onclick),              \n    stackgroups = TRUE,                  \n    binwidth = 1,                        \n    method = \"histodot\") +               \n  scale_y_continuous(NULL,               \n                     breaks = NULL)\ngirafe(                                  \n  ggobj = p,                             \n  width_svg = 6,                         \n  height_svg = 6*0.618)                                        \n\n\n\n\n\nInteractivity: Web document link with a data object will be displayed on the web browser upon mouse click.\n\n\n3.6.7 Coordinated Multiple Views with ggiraph\n\np1 &lt;- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(              \n    aes(data_id = ID,\n        tooltip= ID),              \n    stackgroups = TRUE,                  \n    binwidth = 1,                        \n    method = \"histodot\") +  \n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100)) + \n  scale_y_continuous(NULL,               \n                     breaks = NULL)\n\np2 &lt;- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(              \n    aes(data_id = ID),              \n    stackgroups = TRUE,                  \n    binwidth = 1,                        \n    method = \"histodot\") + \n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100)) + \n  scale_y_continuous(NULL,               \n                     breaks = NULL)\n\ngirafe(code = print(p1 + p2), \n       width_svg = 6,\n       height_svg = 3,\n       options = list(\n         opts_hover(css = \"fill: #202020;\"),\n         opts_hover_inv(css = \"opacity:0.2;\")\n         )\n       ) \n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that when a data point of one of the dotplot is selected, the corresponding data point ID on the second data visualisation will be highlighted too."
